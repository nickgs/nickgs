### Hello World. I'm Nick. ðŸ‘‹

My current interests are around the Ethereum blockchain, the practical use of emerging AI technology, and general web technology. 

- I run IT for a leading medical device manufacturer, [ADC](https://www.adctoday.com).
- I partner with companies to build bespoke software focused on e-commerce and content management at [Sego Solutions](https://segosolutions.com).
- I build and run validator infrastructure for the Ethereum blockchain at [Long Island Blockchain](https://liblockchain.xyz).
- I teach creative coding as an adjunct at [Five Town College](https://www.ftc.edu/).
